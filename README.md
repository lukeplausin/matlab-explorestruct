# MATLAB explorestruct struct UI viewer tool

This is a tool for viewing the contents of Matlab structs in a UI. It's useful as structs can sometimes be difficult to explore using the terminal if you do not understand the structure well already.

It uses the Microsoft TreeView control to display and explore any kind of MATLAB structures. The CRC ExploreStruct was designed to expose the contents of the array struct to any depth and plot any of the components. This tool is very useful for programmers using structures in their code.

It is not original work - this repo is based on a project called StructBrowser by Hassan Lahdili which was submitted to the file exchange in 2003. I altered it so that it would work on Matlab r2012 and above, and made some improvements to the UI.
